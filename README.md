# music-controller

I completed this project quite some time ago, and it helped me a lot in learning python, ReactJS and the basic concepts of web application.

This project uses Django as a backend and ReactJS as a frontend and call Spotify Api to retrieve information about the currently playing song.

I followed this play list when building the project Ihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-age0BPVo&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j (When I first started the project, I didn't realize that I needed to upgrade my spotify account to premium to call the api and that was nice)
